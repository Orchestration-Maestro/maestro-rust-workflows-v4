## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Keep the default mutation verdicts while documenting the added `mutants-plan.txt` and first-parent `mutants.diff` evidence; fail closed when Git cannot resolve the mutation scope instead of widening it to the whole workspace.
* Run up to 32 mutation workers per CI group, with plans capped at 64 shards; five concurrent merge groups may request 160 worker slots against the existing 60-runner capacity.
* Stop each mutation worker after 30 minutes, preserve its partial outcomes, and fail aggregation with the incomplete shard indices.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/compare/v3.0.1...v4.0.0) (2026-09-25)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* a repository deletes its own toolbelt files, and each developer runs `rust-gate setup` and adds the PATH line it prints.
* upload-sarif.yml and upload-coverage.yml are removed. Every caller of ci.yml, publish-binaries.yml or publish-crate.yml grants `security-events: write` and `id-token: write`, which GitHub checks at startup for the skipped upload jobs; a release workflow's publisher job adds those two lines. Each repository's ci.yml caller is deleted by rust-gate sync.

### Features

* set up the pinned tools from the gate, not from each repository ([#70](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/issues/70)) ([0f0be71](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/rust-workflows/commit/0f0be71a491a1c5a6944b7b2061eaf2db8fbdb07))
