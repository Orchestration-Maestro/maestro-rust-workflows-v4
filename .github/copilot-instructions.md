# Copilot instructions for maestro-rust-workflows

## Start here

A Rust repository of the organization adds no workflow: the organization's
ruleset runs `ci.yml` on every pull request, and the same run uploads Clippy and
secret-scan findings to the repository's Security tab and coverage and test
results to Codecov; see
[uploads](../docs/ci.md#uploads-to-code-scanning-and-codecov). Codecov needs its
GitHub App installed on the organization; the upload logs in through OIDC, so
there is no Codecov token to store. Every merge goes through the repository's
merge queue, and the run on the merge group's commit, the one the default branch
moves to, files both on the default branch: that is the baseline each pull
request compares against, with no push run and no per-repository workflow.

Paths below are relative to this repository. Before editing, read
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the rules that bind every change,
[CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md) for the words it uses and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how a change is proposed. The
organization's [golden
rules](https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/.github/blob/main/golden-rules/engineering.md)
come first: nothing in a specification, a plan or this repository weakens them.

For quality, engineering or security changes, read
[northstar.md](../docs/standards/northstar.md),
[engineering.md](../docs/standards/engineering.md) and
[security.md](../docs/standards/security.md): this repository's map of the
organization's golden rules.

Keep changes scoped to the request, and read historical plans and specifications
as records, not as instructions to start new work.

## Repository tree

Every tracked file, with what it is for. `rust-gate guide` writes this tree at
every commit and keeps each explanation already here, so improve an explanation
in place.

## Change and verification procedure

1. Read the rules in AGENTS.md that cover the files you change, and keep every
   gate intact: never weaken one to pass.
2. Add an executable regression check for a change in behaviour.
3. The commit hook `rust-gate guide` rewrites this guide when a file is added,
   moved or removed; commit it with the change. The organization's daily drift
   check reports a guide left stale.
4. Run `scripts/bootstrap.sh` once, then `just check`, and report the commands
   you actually ran.
5. Commits are signed, with a conventional title; the default branch takes only
   squash-merged pull requests.
