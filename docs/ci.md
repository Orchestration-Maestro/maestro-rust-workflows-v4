# CI contract

An organization ruleset runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on every pull request of
a Rust repository; see [how a repository is enforced](#how-a-repository-is-enforced).
A caller may still call it as a reusable workflow; see the [README](../README.md)
for safe revision references. The workflow checks out the immutable `github.sha`
with no persisted checkout credential. No workflow-repository helper script is
required in that checkout.

Every step body is one `rust-gate` command: the standard-library-only binary in
`gate/` that the `gate` action builds from this repository at the workflow's own
commit, with every input arriving as an environment variable. A workflow runs in
the consumer's checkout and cannot read this repository's files, so that build
is the only copy the job can trust; the contract tests in `tests/` run the same
commands, and `just check` runs them against the example fixtures. See
[rust-gate.md](rust-gate.md).

The `release` job starts alongside `checks` from validated `mutation-plan`
outputs. The gate bootstraps with its pinned compiler before step-local consumer
compiler and target settings apply. It runs release tests before the auditable build, then the clean
hardening rebuild at the same target path, and stages the immutable payload.
Its workspace and private Cargo state belong to its own runner. Release build
output and diagnostic reports stay under `runner.temp`, outside the consumer
checkout, just as `validate` arranges for `checks`. The release job installs the
same unconditional Linux test toolbelt as `checks` through a shared YAML anchor,
then its additional settings reader, SBOM and auditable-build tools. The consumer
compiler and target apply only to the release steps, not the gate bootstrap.
The existing build and hardening gates still verify packages, SBOMs and binaries.
Required Rust CI waits for this job and refuses failed, cancelled, skipped or
missing release evidence before exposing its same-SHA artifact outputs.

The canonical diagnostic reports keep their existing names for SARIF and Codecov.
Both upload jobs wait for successful release checks before writing their baselines.
Release diagnostics use `<artifact-name>-release-reports`. Preliminary scorecards
mark release controls as not-run; Required Rust CI joins their real outcomes into
`<artifact-name>-final-scorecard`, the authoritative final scorecard. Missing or
invalid outcomes are failed, never counted as passed. Finalization requires exactly
one enforced row for each release control and converts remaining not-run states to
failed. Preliminary cards retain their not-run states. A failed final scorecard
upload also keeps Required Rust CI red.

## How a repository is enforced

The organization's `rust-ci` ruleset requires `ci.yml`, and its `hygiene-ci`
ruleset `hygiene.yml` for a repository without Rust, on every pull request and
merge queue entry of the default branch. Each rule pins a commit of this
repository; the run happens in the pull request's repository, and a failing run
blocks the merge.

A repository therefore holds no `ci.yml` caller. It keeps
`maestro-quality.toml` and the files `rust-gate sync` writes. A run no
workflow called takes its inputs from the `[ci]` table of `maestro-quality.toml`
at the base commit, the tested commit's first parent: a pull request's base
branch, or on a merge group the commit the entry lands on. A pull request
cannot loosen these base-controlled settings; an input the table leaves out
takes its default below, and `platforms` takes `macos windows`.
`mutation-windows`, `mutation-engine` and `coverage-features` are exceptions:
they come from the head, the tested commit itself. Mutation ownership only
moves mutants to additional required jobs, where every one still runs and
must be caught, so it can never skip a mutant. A pull request that adds a
Windows-only file lists it in the same change, and a head that drops one only
makes the Linux shards stricter. Coverage selection is head-controlled so the
same change can add a package feature and select it for coverage. It does not
preserve base-required coverage selections: a head can change or remove them.
All three head policies are validated as a caller's are. Changed-line coverage
only measures lines present in LCOV; cfg-gated bodies disabled in both the
default run and the resolved feature run are absent from its denominator, not
reported as uncovered. The same run uploads the Clippy and secret-scan SARIF to code
scanning and the coverage to Codecov; see
[uploads](#uploads-to-code-scanning-and-codecov). Inside this repository, only a
caller runs `ci.yml` and nothing runs `hygiene.yml`.

### Migrating to the ruleset

This release is breaking in three ways. The ruleset runs `ci.yml` on every pull
request, so a repository's `ci.yml` caller becomes optional and is deleted at
rollout; what it passed in `with:` belongs in `[ci]`. `license-policy: off` is
refused; remove it, since `auto` and `enforce` both apply the organization's
policy. A ruleset run tests macOS and Windows whatever `[ci]` says, and a
`[ci] platforms` value that leaves either out is refused with the value to
write. A caller that keeps calling `ci.yml` keeps its other inputs and defaults.

### Migrating to the central uploads

The next release is breaking in four ways.

1. `ci.yml` uploads SARIF and coverage itself in the run the ruleset starts, so
   each repository's caller, which `rust-gate sync` wrote for those uploads
   alone, is retired: `sync` deletes a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that still
   opens with its header, the caller of `hygiene.yml` included, and
   `managed-files` refuses it until then.
2. `upload-sarif.yml` and `upload-coverage.yml` are gone. A caller pinned to an
   older release keeps working at that commit.
3. A workflow that calls `ci.yml`, or `publish-binaries.yml` or
   `publish-crate.yml`, which call it, grants `security-events: write` and
   `id-token: write` besides its other scopes, or GitHub fails the run at
   startup. A release workflow's publisher job gains two lines:

   ```yaml
       permissions:
         contents: write
         actions: read
         security-events: write  # ci.yml's skipped SARIF upload
         id-token: write  # ci.yml's skipped Codecov login
   ```

4. With no caller, the release a repository declares is the one its other
   workflows pin, or else the version its commit hooks install; see
   [managed files](#managed-files).

## Inputs and outputs

All inputs are optional. Every CI job runs on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04`;
callers cannot override runner selection. Entry jobs refuse `pull_request_target`
before allocating a runner. A fork pull request runs, with no secret and a
read-only token, once an owner approves the external contributor's run. GitHub
passes no configuration variable to it, so `LICENSE_ALLOWLIST` is empty there; a
committed `deny.toml` applies the same way to every pull request. See [runner security requirements](platform-requirements.md#administrator-owned-setup).

<!-- end generated -->

### Direct dependency access

The `registry` step creates a private job-local Cargo home under the runner's
temporary directory. Cargo uses the official sparse crates.io index directly;
no source replacement or registry credential is written or exported. The
runner's own Cargo configuration is left untouched. CI downloads checksum-pinned
tool assets directly from their official GitHub release paths. Neither download
origin is a caller-selectable CI input.

Publication uses GitHub Releases and explicit public crates.io; see
[publishing.md](publishing.md).
The all-zero action pins still require actual published provider revisions;
this local wiring does not establish a hosted CI result.

### Static analysis

Clippy is the static analyser for Rust, and it already runs with every warning
denied across all targets. `clippy-level` widens the rule set rather than adding
a second tool: `pedantic` and `nursery` catch more but also report style opinions
a codebase may legitimately reject, which is why the default stays at the groups
Rust itself treats as correctness-relevant. Two lints are denied at every level:
`todo!()` and `dbg!()` are scaffolding and do not belong in release code.

Clippy runs once: its JSON diagnostics and SARIF are saved before its exit
status is propagated, including when warnings fail the gate.

CodeQL adds taint tracking on top of Clippy. It is not a step of this workflow:
organization administrators enable CodeQL default setup, which runs it for every
repository; see
[platform requirements](platform-requirements.md#administrator-owned-setup).

### Uploads to code scanning and Codecov

When no workflow called `ci.yml`, in the run the organization's ruleset starts
on a pull request or a merge group, two jobs upload the same run's
`<artifact-name>-reports` artifact after `checks`, portability and any planned
mutation aggregation finish. A sharded run uploads the canonical bundle only
when `mutation-summary` succeeds; nonsharded runs intentionally skip that job.
No repository holds a workflow for these uploads.

- `upload`, "Upload Clippy and secret-scan SARIF", shows the Clippy and
  secret-scan SARIF in the Security tab under the categories `clippy` and
  `gitleaks`, next to CodeQL. It holds `security-events: write`. A repository
  that sets `sarif-reports = false` writes no SARIF, and the job uploads none.
- `coverage`, "Upload coverage and test results to Codecov", sends
  `coverage.lcov` and `tests.xml` to Codecov, which shows line coverage on each
  pull request and flags flaky or failing tests. It logs in through OIDC with
  `id-token: write`, so no Codecov token is stored, and checks out the tested
  commit so Codecov can map report paths onto files.

Both skip fork pull requests, whose token can neither write security events
nor log in to Codecov; their reports stay in the artifact. Both are skipped
when a workflow calls `ci.yml`, but GitHub checks a called workflow's scopes
when the run starts, a skipped job's included, so every caller grants
`security-events: write` and `id-token: write`; the publishers grant them to
their CI run, and their own callers to them.

A failed SARIF upload fails the run. The Codecov upload is advisory: the
`coverage-threshold` and changed-line gates of the checks job decide whether
coverage passes, and Codecov only reports, so an outage of Codecov fails no
run. The Codecov action would run a CLI it downloads itself even when that
CLI's signature check fails, once it tolerates errors; so the job installs the
CLI from its GitHub release asset, verified by digest, and hands the action
that binary.

Organization rulesets start `ci.yml` on pull requests and merge groups, never
on a push, so the default branch's baselines come from the merge queue. A
`merge-queue` ruleset on each repository sends every merge of the default
branch through a merge group, squashed; GitHub accepts its `merge_queue` rule
in a repository ruleset only, never in an organization's. The ruleset builds up
to five merge groups concurrently (`max_entries_to_build: 5`). GitHub moves the
branch to a group's commit only once every required check passed on it, so the
merge group's run tests the exact commit that lands. On a merge group both jobs
file that run's results on the default branch, the SARIF with `ref` set to
`refs/heads/<default branch>` and `sha` to the group's commit, the Codecov
reports with that branch and commit. Code scanning then compares each pull
request with the analysis of the commit it branched from, and Codecov's project
change, default-branch trend and test analytics follow every merge. A pull
request's run keeps its own ref and commit. No repository holds a file for
this, no secret is stored and no app gains a permission.

Only a commit that lands may be filed on the default branch. A merge group
whose portability legs or mutation aggregation failed uploads nothing, since
the queue drops it; a pull request may upload after a portability failure, but
never after failed or incomplete mutation evidence. The ruleset builds one group at a
time, `max_entries_to_build: 1`, so no group is built on an entry ahead of it
that may still fail. One case remains: a required check outside `ci.yml`, such
as CodeQL's, that fails a group after both uploads ran. Its results then stay
the default branch's latest until the next merge files its own.

Without that ruleset nothing uploads on the default branch: code scanning keeps
comparing with the last analysis recorded there under the same job and
categories, and Codecov's default-branch reports age.

### On a merge group

The merge group's commit is one squashed pull request on top of the default
branch, or of the entries ahead of it in the queue. Its first parent is the
base commit, so the settings, the mutated change and the baselines read the
same change the pull request's own run did. The steps that measure a pull
request against its base, changed-line coverage, the [pull request
rules](#pull-request-rules), [public API
compatibility](#public-api-compatibility) and the [performance
budget](#performance-budget), record that they did not apply, as on a push: the
queue admits a pull request only once its own run passed them against the
same change, and a merge group has no title to read. Every other check runs
again on the commit that lands.

### Every rule

The gate's rules are one list, `gate/src/checks/gate_rules.tsv`: each rule's
ID, its short name, what it holds, and whether `maestro-quality.toml` may
excuse a finding of it. `rust-gate gate-rules` prints the list, and the
organization's page renders it at every release. A rule joins the gate by
joining the list: a test refuses a rule the gate's code names that the list
lacks, and a table of this page that names one. The sections below say how each
rule is checked.

### Function and file sizes

The `complexity` step measures every function's cognitive complexity, length
and parameter count through Clippy, and every Rust file's lines of code with
doc comments not counted. It never fails the run: the counts land in
`complexity.txt` and `complexity.json`, in the step summary, and as one line
of the scorecard that changes no score. The thresholds are the consumer's
own `clippy.toml` when one is committed, and otherwise the organization's,
which the gate hands Clippy through `CLIPPY_CONF_DIR`: cognitive complexity
15, 100 lines and 5 parameters per function, with 300 lines of code per file.
The organization's lints deny the three in every repository that writes them
with `rust-gate lints --write`.

### Duplicated functions

The `duplication` step lists the pairs of functions whose syntax trees match
at 90 % or more, among functions of eight lines or more, through
similarity-rs; the listing lands in `duplication.txt` and its count in the
step summary. A pair is reported and never fails the run. Three functions or
more that the pairs join into one shape fail it, DUP-001, the rule of three:
the third copy is the signal to extract what they share. A shape shared on
purpose takes a DUP-001 exception in `maestro-quality.toml`, named by the
first function's file and name. When similarity-rs itself fails, the report
says so and the step does not guess.

### Repository hygiene

`rust-gate hygiene` reads every file git tracks in the checkout, and every new
file it does not ignore, whatever its language, and refuses:

| Rule | Refuses |
| --- | --- |
| HYG-001 | A `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK` or `XXX` in a Rust, shell, TOML, YAML or justfile comment without `#123` or an issue URL |
| HYG-002 | A pending snapshot committed, `*.snap.new` or `*.pending-snap` |
| HYG-003 | A file over 500 KB, unless an exception records the asset |
| HYG-004 | An executable without a shebang, a shebang without the executable bit, two paths differing only by case, a symlink whose target is missing or lies outside the repository |
| HYG-005 | A missing `README.md` or `LICENSE`, or a missing `CHANGELOG.md` beside a release-please configuration |
| HYG-006 | A file not named the way its kind is named across the organization |
| HYG-007 | A word the organization's glossary or the repository's `CONTEXT.md` marks `_Never_` |
| SIZE-003 | A shell script or justfile line over 100 columns |

HYG-006 reads each file's kind from its place, its extension and the mode
git's index records, so a run on Windows agrees with one on Linux. A
Markdown page is in lowercase kebab-case, or `UPPER_SNAKE` for a community
file such as `README.md` or `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`; a page under a docs/adr
directory, at any depth, is `NNNN-title.md` or `README.md`. A Rust file is in snake_case, a
file under `.github/workflows/` is a `.yml` in kebab-case, a `.sh` file or an
executable is in kebab-case, and any other `.py` file, which Python imports,
is in snake_case. Files under a `fixtures`, `testdata` or `snapshots`
directory stand in for somebody else's and are not read. A name an outside
tool imposes takes an exception naming its path.

HYG-007 splits every text file into lowercase words, whatever the case it is
written in, URLs left out, and refuses each word a glossary marks `_Never_`:
the organization's glossary, which this release carries in
`gate/golden-rules/glossary.md`, and the repository's own `CONTEXT.md`, each
parenthesised note of its `_Never_` list left out. A Markdown link's text is
read and its URL is not. A term matches the same words in a row, written as
one word or split in up to one more word than it has, so `AllowList`,
`allow_list` and `ALLOW_LIST` match the one-word term allowlist; its end also
matches with `s`, `es` or `ed`, or `ies` for a final `y`. The finding names the term the
glossary defines instead. Records keep the words of their day, so
`CHANGELOG.md` and whatever lies under docs/adr, `docs/superpowers/` or specs,
at any depth, are not read, nor is a glossary or `maestro-quality.toml`. An
`_Avoid_` word is not refused: whether it means the concept depends on the
sentence, and review judges that. A use the repository must keep takes an
exception naming its path and, as its `item`, the word as the finding prints
it: lowercase, its words separated by one space.

The findings, and the ones an exception excuses with its reason, are in
`hygiene.txt`.

### Managed files

The `managed-files` step refuses every file of the list below whose bytes differ from what the gate
renders, missing ones included, names them in `managed-files.txt`, and says
the fix, `rust-gate sync`. Each managed file opens with
`# generated by rust-gate sync; do not edit`. Only what a tool or GitHub reads
from the repository itself is managed; the gate hands every other tool the
organization's configuration at run time.

| Repository | Managed files |
| --- | --- |
| Every one | `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `typos.toml`, and outside maestro-rust-workflows `.github/dependabot.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` |
| Rust, a root `Cargo.toml` or `rust-toolchain.toml` | `rust-toolchain.toml` and the lint block of the root `Cargo.toml` |

Each stays for a reader outside the gate: editors and editorconfig-checker
read `.editorconfig`; git reads `.gitattributes`; typos takes the words a
repository means only from a file, and its hook runs without the gate; rustup
and Cargo read `rust-toolchain.toml`; rustc, Clippy and editors read the lint
block; GitHub reads `dependabot.yml`, and prek reads
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

| Tool | The organization's configuration, at run time |
| --- | --- |
| rustfmt | `--config style_edition=2024`, in `quality` and the `rustfmt` hook |
| Clippy | `CLIPPY_CONF_DIR`, a directory the gate writes the thresholds to, in `quality`, `complexity` and `rust-gate clippy --local`; a `clippy.toml` the repository writes itself is Clippy's instead, no looser (LNT-001) |
| cargo-deny | `--config`, DEP-001 rendered under the runner's temporary directory, in `licenses` |
| nextest | `--config-file`, TST-004's profile, `retries = 0`, in `quality` |
| taplo | `--no-auto-config --option array_auto_collapse=false`, and the hook leaves `supply-chain/` to cargo-vet |
| yamlfmt | `-formatter` with the indentation, comment padding and line endings |
| rumdl | `--disable MD013,MD041` and the HTML elements MD033 allows; the hook leaves `CHANGELOG.md` to release-please |

A repository still holding `.config/nextest.toml`, the retired caller
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.rumdl.toml`, `.taplo.toml`, `.yamlfmt.yml`,
`clippy.toml`, `deny.toml` or `rustfmt.toml` as sync wrote them, header first,
is refused until `rust-gate sync` deletes them;
a file without the header is the repository's own and stays. rumdl's settings
are the exception: at the root, a `.rumdl.toml`, a `.markdownlint` file or a
`pyproject.toml` rumdl table would loosen every Markdown file, so
`managed-files` and `rust-gate sync --check` refuse them there. In a
subdirectory, rumdl applies a `.rumdl.toml` to that subdirectory alone, which
exempts test fixtures compared byte for byte. A `deny.toml`
the repository wrote itself is refused by `licenses`: DEP-001 holds for every
repository, and its exceptions live in `maestro-quality.toml`.

Run in a repository's root, `rust-gate sync` writes them and `rust-gate
sync --check` compares them, at the release the repository declares, the first
found: `RUST_WORKFLOWS_PIN='<commit> v<version>'`, which moves it; the retired
caller while it is there; the commit every other workflow that calls
maestro-rust-workflows pins, in `.github/workflows/` or the organization's workflow
templates, which must all pin the same one; or the version its commit hooks
install. Workflows that pin different releases are refused, with the fix: set
`RUST_WORKFLOWS_PIN` and run `sync`. Every call to maestro-rust-workflows moves to the
declared release and counts as managed: a release job pinned apart from the
check would ship with a gate the check never ran, and Dependabot leaves every
maestro-rust-workflows pin to `sync`. `rust-gate init` writes them for a repository
that declares no release yet, at the release `RUST_WORKFLOWS_PIN` names. What
a repository may say goes in `maestro-quality.toml`: the words it means,
`[typos] words = ["jaq"]`, and the inputs a ruleset run takes instead of a
caller's, `[ci] platforms = "macos windows linux-arm"`, where
`macos` and `windows` are never left out
([platform portability](#platform-portability)). DEP-001, the policy
`licenses` renders, holds one version of each crate, no wildcard requirement,
crates.io alone, no yanked or unmaintained crate, and the reviewed licences; a
duplicate the ecosystem forces is a DEP-001 exception whose `path` names the
crate and version, `windows-sys@0.52`, rendered as one of cargo-deny's skips
with its reason. A git dependency the organization patched, pinned by commit in
`Cargo.lock`, is a DEP-001 exception whose `path` is the https URL of the
organization's repository, `https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/lbug`,
rendered into cargo-deny's `allow-git`; a source outside
`https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/` is refused. The files every
repository holds as they are here are maestro-rust-workflows' own, read in when the
gate is built: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` and `rust-toolchain.toml`. In
maestro-rust-workflows itself neither `managed-files` nor `sync --check` compares
them, since each would only be compared with itself; what the gate writes from
its data, `typos.toml` and the manifest's lint block, is compared there as
everywhere else. maestro-rust-workflows keeps its own copies of the files other
repositories delete, without the header, for its own `just check`.

### Commit hooks

Every repository's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is a managed file, so the hooks a
commit runs are the organization's: prek's own checks (merge markers, YAML,
TOML and JSON syntax, final newlines, trailing whitespace, line endings, files
over 500 KB, case conflicts, shebangs), then typos, gitleaks over the staged
change, `just --fmt --check` over a root justfile under any name just accepts,
yamlfmt, taplo, actionlint, zizmor, shellcheck, shfmt, rumdl, lychee
offline and editorconfig-checker, each run from the PATH at the version
maestro-rust-workflows' `mise.toml` pins; the commit message rules; and
`rust-gate hygiene --local`, the gate built by Cargo from the release the
repository declares. Each tool takes the organization's options on its command line,
as the table above lists. A Rust repository adds `cargo fmt`, `rust-gate
architecture --local` and, before a push, `rust-gate ci --local`, every step of
this workflow's checks ([run CI before you push](#run-ci-before-you-push)). A
developer needs rustup and the toolbelt of
[the tools on your machine](#the-tools-on-your-machine), nothing else.

The `hooks` step installs that same toolbelt, then runs the same hooks over
every file on it, skipping the formatter, the gate's rules and the pre-push run
of CI, which CI runs as steps of their own; the output is `hooks.txt`. mise asks GitHub's API
for each release's attestations, so the step hands it the job's read-only token
as `MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN`: an anonymous runner shares its rate limit with every
other job on its address. A repository without Rust calls `hygiene.yml` instead
of `ci.yml`: the secret scan, `hygiene`, `pull-request-names`, `managed-files`
and `hooks`, under the check `hygiene / Required hygiene`.

Just's formatter is a hook rather than a step of its own. Like yamlfmt, taplo
and shfmt, it formats a file a repository may hold with or without Rust, so as
a hook it runs on a commit, in `hygiene.yml`, and through the `hooks` step in
`ci.yml` and `rust-gate ci --local`, with no step to declare. It watches the
root alone: `just --fmt` formats the justfile just finds there, not a module
beside it.

### The tools on your machine

One command gives a developer exactly the tools CI runs, at the versions it
runs, in any repository of the organization:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/Orchestration-Maestro/maestro-rust-workflows \
  --tag v<version> rust-gate
rust-gate setup
```

The gate carries maestro-rust-workflows' `mise.toml` and `mise.lock`, read in when it
is built. `rust-gate setup` fetches mise itself and refuses it unless its
SHA-256 is the pinned one, then has mise install every tool under `--locked`
into `~/.cache/maestro/tools/<version>` (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` when set,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\maestro\tools` on Windows), reading no configuration but the
gate's. It links every tool into one directory, `~/.cache/maestro/tools/bin`,
and prints the line that puts it on the PATH; the line stays the same from one
release to the next. Run inside a repository with a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
it also installs the commit hooks. A second run finds everything in place and
takes a fraction of a second. In a GitHub Actions job it also puts the
directory on the PATH of every later step.

The toolbelt is locked for Linux x64 and arm64, macOS x64 and arm64, and
Windows x64. A tool that publishes no build for one of them is built from
crates.io at its pinned version, `cargo install --locked`, as the `# source:`
line above its pin declares. gungraun-runner is the one tool left out: it
drives Valgrind, which runs on Linux alone, so on macOS and Windows `setup`
names it and the [performance budget](#performance-budget) runs in Linux CI.
`toolbelt-platforms.yml` runs `setup` from nothing on each of those platforms,
then a consumer's rendered hooks through the `hooks` step, then
[CI before a push](#run-ci-before-you-push) over the library example.

A repository keeps no tool pins of its own: `managed-files` and `rust-gate
sync --check` refuse a `mise.toml`, `mise.lock`, `.mise.toml`,
`.tool-versions`, a `scripts/bootstrap.sh` that fetches mise, and a
`.github/workflows/tool-updates.yml`, naming `rust-gate setup` as what replaces
them. Only maestro-rust-workflows keeps them, as the source of the pins.

### Run CI before you push

`rust-gate ci --local` runs the `checks` job of this workflow on your machine,
step by step and in its order, so CI confirms what a push already passed
rather than discovering it. A Rust repository's pre-push hook runs it, and so
can you, from anywhere in the repository:

```bash
rust-gate ci --local               # ends at the first failing step, as CI does
rust-gate ci --local --keep-going  # runs every step whatever failed before it
```

It checks what a push sends: the commits, never an uncommitted change. On a
branch it checks what the pull request's run checks, a merge whose tree is the
branch's last commit and whose first parent is where the branch left the
default branch `origin/HEAD` names. The settings therefore come from that
base's `maestro-quality.toml`, changed-line coverage and mutation testing see
the branch's whole change, and the pull request rules read the branch's name
and, as the title, the subject of its first commit; set `PULL_REQUEST_TITLE` to
the title you will give the pull request. On the default branch it runs as a
push.

Each step is the `rust-gate` command CI runs, from the gate the hook pins, with
the tools of [the tools on your machine](#the-tools-on-your-machine) at the
pins CI installs, in the environment a runner gives it: nothing of your shell
but what finds your user, your toolchains and your network, plus
`LICENSE_ALLOWLIST` when you set it, the organization's variable a run is
handed. A `RUSTFLAGS` or a `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` of yours never reaches a step.
The clone, the job's temporary directory and what CI's cache keeps between
runs, the Cargo registry and the build directory, live beside the toolbelt in
`~/.cache/maestro/ci/<repository>-<digest>`, outside the repository, so a
second run rebuilds only what changed.

The first failing step ends the run, as it ends the job, and the scorecard
still says what ran. The run ends with every step, how it ended and how long it
took. A step only GitHub can run says `not applied locally` and why: the gate's
checkout and build, the tool installations, whose tools the toolbelt already
holds, the artifact uploads, and the portability, upload and required-status
jobs. On macOS and Windows `hardening` is not applied, since it reads the ELF
binaries a Linux build writes, and the build targets the machine's own
platform; `performance` runs only with Valgrind on the PATH. Every other step
runs the same on Linux, macOS and Windows, with no tool the toolbelt does not
hold: the gate computes each digest itself and gives every tar the arguments
GNU and BSD tar read alike. A test runs the command against the job and fails
when a step of `ci.yml` is neither run nor declared not applied
(`every_step_of_the_ci_job_runs_locally_or_says_why_not`), and
`toolbelt-platforms.yml` runs it on a runner of each of the five platforms,
the library example's default branch passing and a failing test stopped at the
quality step
(`every_platform_runs_ci_s_checks_before_a_push_and_stops_a_broken_change`).
Each run checks out a fresh clone, as a runner does, so a build a mutant of the
last run left is never taken for this run's sources.

maestro-rust-workflows has no Cargo package at its root and no `ci.yml` run of its
own; its pre-push hook runs `just check`.

### Report-only gate mutation measurement

[gate-mutation.yml](../.github/workflows/gate-mutation.yml) measures all of
`gate/src` on manual dispatch and a weekly Monday schedule. It is report-only:
no ruleset or required repository check depends on it. Misses fail its jobs so
the result stays visible, without blocking existing required checks. Stage one
runs the gate unit suite. Stage two consumes that same run's complete evidence
and replays every recorded miss and timeout against the gate unit suite, the
normal workflow contracts and the two ignored example contracts. No survivor
is fixed by this workflow.

The workflow uses the same `mutants-plan`, round-robin `mutants` shards and
`mutants-aggregate` validation as consumers. `MUTATION_FULL_SCOPE=true` selects
the whole project instead of its first-parent diff and binds that scope in the
immutable plan. This optional step environment setting is not a reusable
workflow input; existing consumers keep their diff selection. Each worker has
the existing 30-minute command limit and must finish every planned mutant.
Each isolated worker sets `MUTATION_IN_PLACE=true`: the gate embeds files outside
its crate, which cargo-mutants copy mode would omit. This optional execution
setting is also not a reusable input and defaults to copy mode. After execution
only mutation evidence is uploaded; no executable or mutated source tree is
reused.
The manual `mutants-per-shard` input adjusts automatic planning, initially 50,
without sampling. Raw shard evidence, the immutable plan and the aggregated
report are retained for 14 days, including failed and incomplete runs.

The repository-owned ignored test in
`tests/repository/gate_mutation_replay/replay_worker.rs` preserves
every recorded diff hunk, applies it with Git and restores the source with
`git checkout` before recording an outcome. The replay plan binds round-robin
ownership to the stage-one revision, placing timeouts first so each shard owns
at most one; aggregation requires every assigned
identity exactly once, including unviable and timed-out mutants. Missing,
duplicate or incomplete shard evidence cannot produce a final survivor report.
Each worker reuses normal CI's `scripts/bootstrap.sh` to provision rustfmt,
Clippy, LLVM tools and the locked toolbelt once before its clean full-suite
baseline. Parallel example contracts never race to install a component. The release binary uses optimization level zero to avoid optimizer rebuild
cost, but retains release assertion semantics.

Stage-one misses have a 180-second total build-and-test budget. Stage-one
timeouts are replayed once with 300 seconds, and reported separately as slow
kills, survivors, build refusals or continuing timeouts. Each replay command
retains the 30-minute shard cap and uploads its progress receipt even when
incomplete. Build phases are uncapped. Test phases and the clean baseline inherit a
2 GiB private-writable-data limit through Bash `ulimit -d`; unlike a virtual
address limit, it permits Gitleaks' reserved address space. The wrapper refuses
failed setup or a mismatched effective limit before launching the child. Receipts
record the verified effective limit, not merely the requested value. Test threads are
one, with at most two capped test processes (the harness and its sequential
child), and their combined limits must stay below 75% of the runner's recorded
MemTotal. Each receipt records tool setup plus baseline time (at most 300
seconds) and baseline test time excluding cold builds (at most 120 seconds).
A slower clean baseline refuses before applying any mutant. Six mutants,
with at most one prior timeout, fit the enforced 25-minute budget:
300 + 5 times 180 + 300 seconds, below the 30-minute command cap.
Allocation aborts have their own `caught_by_memory_cap` category and
exact log evidence, separate from assertion kills and continuing timeouts.
The manual `replay-per-shard` target defaults to 6 without
sampling. Dispatch from the tested revision so the immutable source binding
remains exact. Weekly runs measure their own current revision, not a fixed
artifact that will expire.

### Pull request rules

Measured on a pull request only, against its base branch, the merge commit's first parent:

| Rule | Refuses |
| --- | --- |
| COV-002 | New lines that never run, past what the pull request may leave: a `feat` or `fix` title covers 95 % of its coverable new lines, any other 90 %, and `max(1, floor((100 - target) % of n))` of the `n` may stay uncovered, so a three-line change is not failed by one line |
| PRL-001 | A `feat` or `fix` pull request that changes product Rust code, outside a `tests`, `benches` or `examples` directory, and touches no test: no file under a `tests` directory and no new line inside a `#[cfg(test)]` item |
| PRL-002 | Nothing: past 400 changed lines, lockfiles, snapshots and generated files left out, the pull request is reported in the summary |
| PRL-003 | A title that is not a Conventional Commits header as the `conventional-commit-header` hook reads one: a type among `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore` and `revert`, an optional lowercase scope and `!`, then a colon, a space and a subject opening in lowercase within 71 bytes, as the hook counts them. A squash merge makes the title the commit release-please reads. GitHub's Revert button writes `Revert "<header>"`, which passes when the header does, and a title on a `dependabot/*` branch is not held to the length, since Dependabot never shortens one |
| PRL-004 | A head branch other than `<type>/<name>`, the same types, each segment after it lowercase kebab-case with a single `-`, `.` or `_` between letters and digits; the bots' `maestro/sync`, `release-please--*`, `dependabot/*`, `gh-readonly-queue/*` and `copilot/*`, and the `revert-<number>-<branch>` of GitHub's Revert button, pass |

PRL-003 and PRL-004 hold every repository: `hygiene.yml` runs them too, as
`rust-gate hygiene pull-request-names`. The organization's commit-message
ruleset is a metadata rule GitHub enforces only on its Enterprise plan, and a
branch ruleset matches names with `fnmatch`, which cannot hold their case; these
two rules are what refuses them.

Each runs after the other checks of its job, so a name never hides what they
say, and each finding says how to fix it. Neither runs again when a title
changes, and a rerun reads the title its run started with: fix the title, then
push a commit or close and reopen the pull request. A branch cannot be renamed
under an open pull request: open the pull request again from a branch so named.

### Performance budget

Opt-in by declaration: a repository names its benchmarks in `maestro-quality.toml`,
`[performance] benches = ["tokenizer"]`, written with gungraun 0.19.4, the
version the organization's pinned runner matches. On a pull request the
`performance` step installs the runner image's Valgrind at its pinned version,
runs each benchmark on the base, the merge commit's first parent, in a worktree
of its own, then on the pull request, and refuses one whose instruction count
rises more than 5 % (PRF-001). Instruction counts do not move with the runner's
load. A regression the repository accepts is a PRF-001 exception whose `path`
names the bench; its counts are still in `performance.txt`. Without a bench or a
base, the step reports that it does not apply. gungraun-runner exists for Linux
alone, as Valgrind does, so the budget is measured in Linux CI; `rust-gate
setup` leaves it out on macOS and Windows and says so.

`changed-coverage.txt` names every new line that never ran, from the coverage
step's LCOV; `pull-request.txt` holds the size and the PRL findings. A push has
no base, and both steps report that they do not apply.

### Source rules

`rust-gate architecture` reads every target Cargo
reports, the files its `mod` declarations reach and every package's manifest,
and refuses each finding by its identifier, file and line:

| Rule | Refuses |
| --- | --- |
| ARC-001 | An import cycle between files of one crate |
| ARC-002 | A `mod.rs`, or a library root with modules, holding more than `mod` and `use` declarations |
| ARC-003 | A path from outside a door that walks past a name the door re-exports |
| ARC-004 | An import against the layers `maestro-quality.toml` declares for a target |
| ARC-005 | An item a door offers past its parent that one outside module uses and nothing inside shares |
| ARC-006 | A binary root holding more than declarations and a `fn main` of at most 25 lines |
| ARC-007 | A `#[path]` attribute or an `include!` of Rust source |
| SIZE-002 | A file over 500 lines of code, doc comments not counted; over 300 is reported |
| SIZE-003 | A line over 100 columns, strings and comments included |
| NAME-001 | A package name that is not lowercase kebab-case, or a publishable one without the `maestro-` prefix |
| NAME-002 | A test module named in fewer than two words, a test in fewer than four, a `test_` prefix or a `_works`, `_ok` or `_test` suffix |
| NAME-003 | A feature a manifest declares that is not lowercase kebab-case, or that starts with `use-`, `with-`, `enable-`, `has-` or `feature-` (Rust API Guidelines C-FEATURE); a feature Cargo makes of an optional dependency takes the dependency's name and is not judged |
| NAME-004 | In the code a `maestro-` package ships, test, bench and example targets and test items left out, an environment variable read by name through `env::var`, `env::var_os`, `env!` or `option_env!` that neither starts with `MAESTRO_` nor is the platform's: `CARGO_`, `RUST`, `GITHUB_`, `RUNNER_`, `XDG_`, `LC_` and `DEP_` variables, `HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR` and the other names the gate lists |
| DOC-001 | A file that does not open with a `//!` comment |
| LIB-001 | A print macro in a library |
| LIB-002 | A library-only package that depends on `anyhow`, `eyre` or `color-eyre` |
| TST-001 | A test that waits on `thread::sleep`, `time::sleep` or `task::sleep` |
| TST-003 | More than one integration-test crate without required features |
| WSP-001 | A workspace member that does not inherit `[lints]`, `edition`, `rust-version`, `license` or its dependencies |
| WSP-002 | An edition other than 2024, a virtual workspace resolver other than 3, a missing or untracked `Cargo.lock` |
| LNT-001 | A lint of the organization's list not denied in the root manifest's `[workspace.lints]` or `[lints]`, or a committed `clippy.toml` looser than the organization's |

The organization's lints are one list the gate holds: Clippy's `all`,
`pedantic` and `cargo` groups, the lints that keep a panic out of product code
(`unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, `indexing_slicing` and their kin), one
module layout (`self_named_module_files`), short paths and real names
(`absolute_paths`, `min_ident_chars`), the size lints SIZE-001 reads, and
rustc's `missing_docs`, `unreachable_pub` and `unused_qualifications` among
others. The case of every name, `PascalCase` types, `snake_case` functions and
`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants, is rustc's `nonstandard_style`, denied with
the rest; `same_name_method` refuses an inherent method named like a trait's,
and the Rust API Guidelines' naming conventions, `as_`, `to_` and `into_`
among them, come with `all` and `pedantic`. `rust-gate lints --write`, run where the root `Cargo.toml` is, writes
them between two markers; a repository adds its own lints below the block as
dotted keys, `clippy.own_lint = "deny"`, and removes none. Test code keeps
`unwrap`, `expect`, `panic`, indexing and printing through the organization's
Clippy allowances; an integration-test crate opens with `#![cfg(test)]` so Clippy
reads all of it as test code.

`rust-gate rules`, run at the root of a repository, writes its rule map, the
organization's golden rules adapted to it (C-001), from the copy of the golden
rules the release carries: `docs/standards/engineering.md`, `security.md` and
`northstar.md`. A row, a section or a KPI the repository wrote is kept; a rule
the organization holds everywhere gets its default; any other rule arrives as
"Not mapped yet". `rust-gate rules --check` refuses a stale page or a row not
mapped yet. This repository's own rule map is written by `just docs` and
checked in `just check`, from the copy it carries.

`rust-gate guide`, run at the root of a repository, writes its Copilot guide,
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`: where to start, every tracked file with what
it is for, and how to change and verify. An explanation the guide already gives
is kept, so a person can improve any of them; a new file is explained by its
README table row, an image's alternative text, or what the file says of itself.
`rust-gate guide --check` refuses a stale guide.

Both run as commit hooks in every repository but this one, `rust-gate-rules`
and `rust-gate-guide`, at the release the repository declares: a stale page or guide
is rewritten and the commit stops once, so the next one carries it. CI skips
both, so a stale rule map or guide never fails a merge; the organization's
daily drift check reports it. `rust-gate init` writes the rule map, and the
guide in a git repository. Every repository's `typos.toml` allows `FND`, the
foundations' prefix its rule map cites.

`architecture.txt` lists every finding, then every finding an exception
excuses, with its reason, then the files over 300 lines. `maestro-quality.toml`,
at the root of the repository, declares layers, tightens the limits and takes
exceptions; among these rules only ARC-005, TST-001 and NAME-004 take one, and
an exception that excuses nothing is itself refused. A NAME-004 exception names
the file and the variable, for one another tool owns:

```toml
[limits]
file-lines = 400
line-columns = 100

[[crate]]
root = "gate/src/main.rs"
layers = ["steps", "checks", "runner"]

[[exception]]
rule = "ARC-005"
path = "gate/src/runner/mod.rs"
item = "enter"
reason = "the step registry is the only thing that can run a step"

[[exception]]
rule = "NAME-004"
path = "src/server.rs"
item = "LLAMA_ARG_MODEL"
reason = "llama.cpp reads this variable; the name is its own"
```

The rules still to come are in the organization quality gate design,
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-org-quality-gate-design.md`.

### Unsafe code

`deny` adds `-D unsafe_code` to the Clippy invocation. Lints after `--` reach the
selected workspace members only, so a dependency that legitimately uses `unsafe`
never fails the build. `RUSTFLAGS` would apply to the whole dependency graph and
break almost any real project, which is why it is not used here.

The default is `deny`, because a golden workflow enforces the standard; a
project doing FFI sets `allow`, one input, on adoption. `deny` does not detect
undefined behaviour; it forces the decision to be explicit. A member that genuinely needs `unsafe` keeps
a greppable `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` at the site instead of compiling silently.

Detecting undefined behaviour inside `unsafe` needs Miri or the sanitizers, which
are nightly-only and therefore outside stable.

### Fuzz regression

`fuzz.yml` is a separate callable workflow, nightly-only for the same reason as
the undefined-behaviour audit. Fuzzing has no natural stopping point, so an
unbounded run does not belong in CI. This workflow does the part that does: it
replays the committed corpus with `-runs=0` so a previously fixed crash that
regressed fails immediately and deterministically, then explores for a bounded
budget (`max-total-time`, 10 to 1800 seconds per target).

A missing `fuzz/fuzz_targets` directory is an error rather than a skipped run, so
enabling the workflow cannot silently fuzz nothing. The summary states plainly
that a clean run means no crash was reached within the budget, not that none
exists; continuous fuzzing belongs on dedicated infrastructure.

<!-- generated by just docs: inputs fuzz.yml default -->

| Input | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Relative package or workspace directory containing the `fuzz` crate |
| `toolchain` | `nightly-2026-09-14` | Dated nightly keeps the run reproducible |
| `target` | Empty | One fuzz target name; empty runs every target in `fuzz/fuzz_targets` |
| `max-total-time` | `120` | Seconds of exploration per target after the corpus replay, 10 to 1800 |

<!-- end generated -->

### Undefined-behaviour audit

`unsafe-audit.yml` is a separate callable workflow running the consumer's tests
under Miri. It is not an input here because Miri exists only on nightly, and
`ci.yml` accepts only exact stable versions: keeping it apart is what keeps that
true. A regression test enforces that `ci.yml` never mentions nightly.

<!-- generated by just docs: inputs unsafe-audit.yml default -->

| Input | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Relative package or workspace directory |
| `toolchain` | `nightly-2026-09-14` | Dated nightly keeps the run reproducible; plain `nightly` follows today's |
| `test-filter` | Empty | Narrow the run to the tests that exercise `unsafe` |
| `strict-provenance` | `false` | Also reject pointer-provenance mistakes that work today by accident |

<!-- end generated -->

Call it on a schedule or before a release, never on every pull request: Miri
interprets the program instead of executing it, so it is orders of magnitude
slower than a native test run. A finding fails the job.

### Signed build provenance

`attest-binaries.yml` is a separate callable workflow that records and verifies a
GitHub build provenance attestation for a payload CI already produced; the README
explains why it is not a job inside publication.

<!-- generated by just docs: inputs attest-binaries.yml default -->

| Input | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artifact-id` | required | Immutable release artifact ID produced by the CI workflow |
| `revision` | required | Validated source commit that produced the artifact; must equal the checked-out SHA |
| `on-unavailable` | `skip` | Only Enterprise Server identified by a successful metadata response may be skipped; `fail` rejects it. Unknown availability and signing, OIDC, API or verification errors always block |

<!-- end generated -->

Outputs: `subject-digest`, the payload digest verified in this job (empty on a
platform skip), and `attested`, true only after both signing actions and the
independent provenance verification succeed. Callers require `attested == 'true'`
instead of the job's success. Private Cloud entitlement is not inferred from an
API error. GitHub can reject permissions before this runtime policy executes.

### Quality scorecard

Every run publishes a scorecard to the job summary and to the reports artifact as
`scorecard.json`, `scorecard.md` and `scorecard.svg`. It records what the run
actually enforced. Each control has a `state`: `passed`, `disabled`,
`not-applicable`, `failed` or `not-run`. Only `passed` contributes to `active`;
turning a control on is not evidence that it ran. Features and mutations supply
explicit application results. Missing results never count as success. The grouped source, version and licence row
reflects the selected dependency policy; `licenses.txt` states whether a licence
allowlist actually applied. `license-policy: off` is refused, so the row always applies.

The badge is generated here, with no external service and no runtime dependency,
using the palette sampled from this repository's banner. It turns red for a
failed control or an enforced control that did not run. To show it in a README, publish `scorecard.svg` wherever
your project already serves static files and reference that URL; this workflow
deliberately does not write to the consumer's repository, which would require
granting `contents: write` to every caller.

### Release evidence

Ordinary CI artifacts expire after seven days. `publish-evidence.yml` optionally
archives a run's reports as `evidence.tar.gz` on an existing GitHub Release.
It defaults to a local dry-run and accepts `artifact-name`, `revision` and
`dry-run`. Live uploads require a protected release tag and the verified `release`
environment. Reports are source-bound through the scorecard revision and checked
for unsafe files before archiving. This is not durable archival for every run or
immutable regulatory retention. See [the contract](publishing.md#release-evidence).

### Payload bill of materials

`cargo cyclonedx` emits one SBOM per workspace member, but an attestation binds a
single subject, so those files cannot describe the release payload. Staging
therefore merges them with `cyclonedx merge --hierarchical`, producing
`payload.cdx.json`: a root component named `rust-release-payload` with each member
nested beneath it. A flat merge would list shared members twice. The output is
pinned to CycloneDX 1.5, validated by the tool and then re-checked with `jaq`.

The merged document travels inside `payload.tar.gz` and also ships with the
reports. `attest-binaries.yml` extracts it from the verified tarball rather than
fetching a separate copy, so the attested bill of materials is the one whose
checksum was just confirmed.

#### The same dependencies in SPDX

Consumer tooling is split between the two formats, and one a consumer cannot read
is no bill of materials at all. `cargo sbom` therefore emits an SPDX 2.3 document
per workspace member alongside the CycloneDX files.

It is generated, not converted. `cyclonedx convert --output-format spdxjson` was
tried first and rejected on measurement: converting the hierarchical merge lost
nested members, converting a flat merge duplicated shared ones, and both dropped
the SPDX relationship graph entirely. An SBOM that is quietly incomplete is worse
than none, because it looks like an answer.

No SPDX merge exists, because nothing attests these documents; the CycloneDX files
are merged only because an attestation binds exactly one subject. A check compares
the member names in both formats and fails the build when they disagree, so a
consumer's answer cannot depend on which file their tooling happened to read.

#### Dependencies inside the binary

Both release builds run through `cargo auditable`, which embeds the resolved
dependency list in a `.dep-v0` ELF section. A binary copied somewhere its SBOM did
not follow can still be audited:

```bash
cargo audit bin <binary>
```

Both builds use it, or the two binaries would differ and the reproducibility check
would fail for a reason unrelated to reproducibility. Installing the tool and
forgetting to build through it produces a perfectly normal binary and no error, so
the hardening step checks that the section is present rather than assuming it.

### Recorded dependency audits

`dependency-audit` is on by default (VET-001): the `vet` step runs
`cargo vet --locked` over the committed `supply-chain/` ledger, after checking
that its `config.toml` imports the organization's audits, published in
maestro-rust-workflows' `supply-chain/audits.toml` (under its former name
`rust-workflows` too), and those of Mozilla, Google, the
Bytecode Alliance, ISRG and the Zcash Foundation, each at the URL cargo-vet's
registry gives it. A crate one of them reviewed needs no exemption; the
exemptions stay the repository's own reviewed state. `cargo vet init`, the six
`[imports.*]` tables and `cargo vet regenerate imports` set a repository up.

### Reproducible builds and binary hardening

Hardening moves the shipped target directory aside, rebuilds from clean at the
same path and requires matching binary digests, then restores the shipped build
and its cache even if the check fails. The guarantee is identical bytes for the
same source, toolchain and build paths. Path independence is out of scope: rustc
can embed absolute `OUT_DIR` panic locations and registry paths under `CARGO_HOME`.
Consumer rustflags and compiler wrappers are unchanged. Each executable is also
checked for position independence, full RELRO and a non-executable stack; the
result ships as `hardening.txt`. Rust does not emit C stack canaries, so
`__stack_chk` is deliberately not required.

### Declared minimum supported Rust version

Every workspace member must declare `rust-version`, and the declared value must
not exceed the compiler under test. A workspace that omits the field still
compiles on the current toolchain and then breaks silently for a consumer on an
older one; this gate makes the claim explicit and keeps it honest. The result is
published as `msrv.tsv` with the diagnostic reports. This check is always on: it
verifies a declaration the project already owns rather than adding a new policy.

The declaration is then compiled against. Cargo refuses a member whose
`rust-version` sits above the active toolchain, so the oldest compiler the whole
workspace can use is the highest version declared. A declaration such as `1.85`
is normalized to `1.85.0`, not rustup's latest `1.85` patch alias. The step
installs that exact compiler and runs `cargo check --workspace --locked` with
its exact `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`. A member declaring less is carried by that floor and
is never built on its own, which the run reports rather than leaves implied.
Without this build the declaration is a number in a manifest: a workspace can
use an API newer than the version it claims to support and still pass.

### Feature combinations

A default build proves one combination. A feature that nobody selects in CI can
stop compiling and ship that way, and the consumer who turns it on is the one
who finds out. `cargo hack check --each-feature` builds each declared feature on
its own, the default set, none of them and all of them: linear in the number of
features, where a full powerset would be exponential and price the gate out of
every run. This is not a powerset or every optional feature added to defaults.
A workspace declaring no feature is `not-applicable`, not an active control.

Feature checks remove dev-dependencies so their feature unification cannot hide
an otherwise broken feature. The gate snapshots the workspace manifests and
`Cargo.lock` at fresh Cargo metadata's `workspace_root`, even when `PROJECT`
names a member. A member-local lock is untouched. It then uses
`cargo hack --remove-dev-deps` with `--offline`.
This is `--no-dev-deps` without cargo-hack's own restoration, which would hide
lockfile changes before validation. Every remaining package must keep its locked
name, version, source and checksum; the lock may only lose packages. The gate
restores every snapshotted file byte for byte, including after a failed check or
lockfile refusal. Earlier locked steps populate the fresh CI Cargo home; an
uncached dependency fails offline rather than being fetched.
The names it found are published as `features.txt`. The example replay includes
the step; a separate real multi-feature fixture rejects both an invalid isolated
feature and an invalid all-features combination.

### Yanked dependencies

`cargo deny check ... advisories` covers the one case `cargo audit` does not: a
crate withdrawn from the registry. A yanked crate stays resolvable from a
committed lockfile indefinitely, so it is a distinct failure from a published
vulnerability. The check reads the registry index and therefore needs network
access, which the hosted run has.

CI accepts no secret.

### Reviewed secret-scan exceptions

The gate embeds [the organization's reviewed list](../policy/secret-scan-exceptions.json)
when built from the workflow's pinned revision. No list, `.gitleaks.toml`,
`.gitleaksignore` or inline Gitleaks allow comment in the consumer checkout grants
an exception. Every approval requires four exact keys: `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` as
`owner/name`, repository-relative `path`, Gitleaks `rule` (`RuleID`), and `sha256`.
There are no globs, wildcard rules or line-number keys. Built-in Gitleaks rules
remain unchanged. A separate scan uses only the gate-owned `gitleaks-allow` rule,
without inherited rules or global allowlists, and combines its findings with the
secret scan. Every inline suppression marker is itself a finding, even on a line
containing no secret or in a path the built-in rules allow. Its `Match` is the
entire line, so approving one marker cannot approve changed surrounding code.

Gitleaks automatically loads an archived root `.gitleaksignore`, regardless of
its explicit ignore-path option. The gate moves that file to an unused archive
name before scanning and maps findings back to `.gitleaksignore`. Its content is
still scanned, but its fingerprints cannot suppress findings. A consumer
`.gitleaks.toml`, `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` or `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` cannot replace the
gate's explicit configuration.

Approvals apply only in hosted CI (`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`), using the runner's
nonempty `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`. A hosted scan with missing or empty repository
identity fails as a misconfiguration. A local scan, including `ci --local`,
prints a notice and scans without exceptions or stale-entry warnings, even if a
repository variable was supplied manually. Identity is never inferred from
consumer files or Git remotes.

The SHA256 covers the UTF-8 bytes of Gitleaks' entire unredacted `Match`, including
whitespace, not just `Secret`. This binds surrounding flagged code as well as the
secret candidate: any change to the flagged text requires a new review, while
moving it to another line does not. The raw scanner report travels only through
private process pipes and memory, never a file or job log. JSON and SARIF contain
only redacted values, locations, hashes and approval metadata.

Excepted findings remain visible in the step log and `secrets.json`, marked
`Status: excepted` with their full `Exception` entry. SARIF marks them with accepted
external suppressions. Every other finding fails the step. An approval for the
current repository that matches nothing produces a stale-entry warning, not a
failure; approvals for other repositories produce no warning.

To request an exception, open a pull request to this repository adding the four
keys plus `reason`, `approved_by` and `approved_on` to the central list. Provide
false-positive evidence without publishing matched text or secret material.
An organization review and a release are required before the pinned gate can
use it. Consumers cannot approve their own findings.

### Run cost

Every pinned Rust tool is installed from a checksum-verified prebuilt release
rather than built with `cargo install`. Compiling them from source cost each
caller minutes of runner time on every job, multiplied by the compiler matrix.
Optional tools download only when their gate is selected. On every action
invocation, `rust-gate` compiles from this repository at the workflow's commit
with its own pinned compiler in a fresh directory. Neither its executable nor
its Cargo build fingerprints are restored from a previous job.

The `checks` job has a 240-minute hang ceiling, not an expected duration. Cold
native coverage, public API comparisons and per-feature checks can each compile
an opt-in engine independently. Pi has no CI-job or mutation timeout; its
30-minute default run timeout applies to agent runs, not these jobs.

Opt-in mutation sharding adds one worker job per shard (up to 256) and a summary
job; the matrix runs at most 32 workers concurrently, so five merge groups may
request up to 160 worker slots while the runner plan provides 60. Excess jobs
queue at GitHub; small plans use fewer than 32 workers. Ordinary Linux shard
commands are interrupted after 30 minutes, with a one-minute kill grace and
four minutes for reporting before the 35-minute step limit; the 45-minute job
limit also leaves setup and upload time. Engine-enabled shards use 60, 65 and
75 minutes respectively to include a cold native build. Local and unsharded runs invoke cargo-mutants directly,
without a platform-specific timeout command. Each worker builds the gate,
downloads the early plan, runs a baseline and its mutants, then
uploads evidence. Treat these as runner-minute costs, not a wall-
clock promise; the hosted pilot measures actual setup, execution and summary
latency.

For a 6,895-mutant diff at the 50-mutant target, automatic planning creates 138
shards averaging about 50 mutants. Based on the v4.4.0 observation that 100
mutants took 32.5-35.8 minutes, a linear estimate is about 16-18 minutes of
mutation work per shard. At 32 workers, five waves plus setup and summary give an expected wall time of
about 90 minutes. This is an estimate, not hosted timing evidence. Five concurrent merge groups can request 160 worker slots against
the organization's 60-runner capacity; GitHub queues excess jobs.

The workflow restores a Cargo registry and build cache keyed on the resolved
`Cargo.lock` and the selected compiler, so a lockfile or toolchain change can
never reuse an incompatible build. A `concurrency` group supersedes in-flight
runs for the same caller, reference, working directory, artifact key and requested
Rust version; only pull requests cancel a run in progress, so matrix versions do
not cancel each other and a running push or tag run always finishes. GitHub keeps
at most one waiting run per group, so a newer push replaces a run still waiting
for its turn; every release tag is its own group.

### Diagnostic reports

The `<artifact-name>-reports` artifact carries the results that were produced.
The table describes selection, not a promise that every file exists after an
earlier failure. The scorecard identifies controls that never ran. In sharded mode, `checks`
first records mutation as `not-run`; only aggregation can finalize it as passed
or failed from complete evidence.

A step that runs and chooses to skip records that decision. A step prevented
from starting cannot write a report; its scorecard state is `not-run` unless
selection or explicit applicability evidence establishes another state. A
successful nextest invocation with no JUnit file or an empty one is refused.
Doctests run separately through Cargo and are not included in this JUnit.

### Licence, dependency-ban and source policy

The gate runs `cargo deny check licenses bans sources advisories` against the
consumer's own `deny.toml`, so each team keeps its reviewed policy rather than
inheriting one from this repository. A project with no `deny.toml` still gets the
line every project must hold, written by the step into a generated
configuration: dependencies come only from crates.io directly, never from an
unapproved git repository, and a version requirement cannot be a wildcard. A project that needs a git dependency
commits its `deny.toml` and says so there. The binary fixture carries one
crates.io dependency, so the local gate checks the generated policy against a
real lockfile rather than an empty graph.

Licences are the one part with no default: they are checked against the
`LICENSE_ALLOWLIST` organization variable when administrators set it
(comma-separated SPDX identifiers), and the report says `licences NOT APPLIED`
otherwise. No list is assumed here. The day administrators set the variable, every project
without a policy is covered without a release. Advisories stay with `cargo audit`, which also denies yanked, unsound
and unmaintained crates; the two gates are deliberately separate.

`license-policy` stays accepted for the repositories that set it: `auto` and
`enforce` both apply the organization's policy, and neither requires a committed
`deny.toml`. `off` is refused before any work, since no repository opts out:

```text
license-policy=off is refused: the organization's licence policy always applies, and no repository opts out
```

### Feature coverage

`coverage-features` is a JSON array of qualified `package/feature` strings.
A nonempty workflow input overrides `[ci] coverage-features` in the tested
head's `maestro-quality.toml`, exactly as `mutation-engine` does. An absent
input and absent policy keep the original coverage command and thresholds.
An explicit empty array, malformed entry, duplicate, nonmember package or
undeclared feature is refused using Cargo metadata.

For a selection, the checks job cleans coverage profiles, runs the default
workspace tests with `--no-report`, then workspace tests with `--no-report
--features <list>`, and generates one `cargo llvm-cov report --lcov` report.
The line floor is evaluated once on that union; the changed-line gate reads
that same LCOV. Default-only branches remain in the report. No downloaded
coverage artifact participates in either verdict. The job checks its clean
checkout against its source SHA before and after execution and reporting,
and records both invocations, features, revision and elapsed seconds in
`coverage-binding.txt` and its summary. Both publishers forward the input.
Mutation flags and `cargo hack --each-feature` remain unchanged.

### Mutation testing

Mutation testing builds and tests the workspace once per generated mutant. It
is on by default, because a golden workflow enforces the standard, and every
run mutates only its change: a pull request's merge diff against the base, a
merge group's diff, or a push or tag's first-parent diff. Squash-only merges
make each default-branch commit exactly one pull request's change. Only a
repository's first commit, which has no parent, mutates the whole workspace.

A repository that owns Windows-only Rust code lists its exact relative paths in
`[ci].mutation-windows`. The Linux mutation listing and workers exclude those
files; the pinned Windows job mutates them on `windows-2025` and uploads its
raw outcomes as an artifact. A pull request first confirms each touched file has
mutants, then mutates only those in changed lines; a file with no changed-line
mutants is reported as skipped. A pull request reports a successful no-op when
it touched none. A full run requires at least one mutant from every listed file.
Missing files, empty required listings, survivors and timeouts fail the job,
which the required status holds.

`[ci.mutation-engine]` lists exact Rust files and package-local features. The
planner retains their featureless mutants as separate control obligations and
lists owning packages again with those features. Mode-specific mutants outside
that ownership are refused. Both modes use the existing count-based planner
independently, with separate required Linux matrices. Engine-enabled commands
have 60 minutes: a 21-minute cold native build, the ordinary 30-minute shard
allowance and nine minutes of margin. Their step limit is 65 minutes, including
one minute of kill grace and four for reporting; the job limit is 75 minutes,
adding ten for setup and uploads. Featureless controls select no engine features
and retain the 30-minute command, 35-minute step and 45-minute job limits.
Default and Windows workers never receive feature flags. The aggregate verifies
both matrices and the Windows job, then joins outcomes with explicit mode labels.
A shared default-caught mutant becoming unviable fails; an already-unviable shared
identity is allowed; a newly discovered feature-only unviable fails. Package and
partition counts are reported so offsets cannot hide regressions.

The early `mutation-plan` job exports its resolved policy, features and files as immutable
job outputs.
Every mutation worker validates that resolved policy, including input-only ownership when
no repository policy exists; workers never reselect ownership from the caller or checkout.
Without an engine policy, existing `.cargo/mutants.toml` settings remain unchanged. Global
feature/workspace-test restrictions apply only when engine ownership is configured.

The featureless control compiles each assigned owning package's default test targets separately,
without running tests, in its own clean target directory. Its command mirrors pinned cargo-mutants
27.1.0's package-scoped Cargo or Nextest build, including version-qualified selection and
default-off `cap_lints`. With `test_tool = "nextest"`, it runs `cargo nextest run --no-run
--verbose --cargo-verbose --package=<name@version> --locked`, adding `--cargo-message-format=json` to
forward Cargo's build evidence and `--target-dir` for the clean directory. It leaves
Cargo's Rust flag resolution unchanged. Cargo JSON and rustc dep-info
establish compile membership, including test-only modules and build scripts. Retained Cargo
source metadata verifies the project/workspace coordinate frame and every planned owner.
The control retains the raw evidence, configuration, digests and a schema-4 binding to the
complete source/run/shard receipt. Each package entry binds its build argv, raw compiler log and
dep-info evidence. Paths derive from rustc's crate name, output directory and extra filename;
uplifted integration-test binaries do not need a sibling `.d` file. Each fresh Cargo artifact
must match exactly one rustc invocation with dep-info emission. A Cargo test profile requires
`--test` or explicit `--cfg test`, including `harness = false` targets. A non-test profile refuses
`--test` but permits user-supplied `--cfg test`; only non-test binary targets can match uplifted
outputs from a `/deps` directory. Missing compiler records, malformed quoting and missing
dep-info fail closed with the unit named. Unescaped double quotes outside single-quoted
arguments are refused; literal double quotes inside them, such as `--cfg 'feature="engine"'`,
are preserved. Schema-3 or mixed
compiler evidence is refused;
aggregation rechecks every equivalent command and frame. A mutant is classified only against
its own package build, never the union of dependency feature sets. Project paths lexically
drop dot components once, without resolving symlinks.
A file absent from this verified build cannot affect default behavior. Its assigned mutants
receive the explicit `NotCompiledWithoutFeatures` outcome, with no test phase and no
per-mutant test invocation. They remain in the complete plan and outcome accounting;
they are not relabelled caught, missed or unviable. When every assigned mutant is inactive,
one baseline document records the successful build phase of every owning package. The pinned
JSON reader collects all build records explicitly, rather than slurping files separately.

Only assigned mutants in compiled files run through cargo-mutants, selected by anchored,
escaped exact names. A retained config copy removes only `examine_re`, so inherited inclusion
regexes cannot broaden that exact selection; all other discovery and execution settings stay
unchanged. With verified membership, every compiled control survivor fails, even if its
engine twin is caught: default-compiled code in an engine-owned file must be killed by
default tests. A cargo-mutants configuration that changes compilation, features, profile or
Cargo arguments, or contains an unknown key, disables absence classification conservatively.
Enabled `cap_lints` or a package working directory below the workspace root also use this
fallback. An unverified package version falls back only for that package. The worker logs the
unverified owner and tests every assigned mutant for it; verified owners still classify
non-members and reject compiled survivors. Unverified
featureless survivors retain the previous acceptance rule: aggregation requires an exact
caught engine twin. Fallback never produces `NotCompiledWithoutFeatures` outcomes. Existing global feature/workspace-test
restrictions remain in place. No timeout, shard count, default or limit is increased.

Aggregation rechecks the receipt binding, successful fresh Cargo build, every retained
dep-info unit and digest, raw tested subset, complete outcome identities and counters.
It accepts `NotCompiledWithoutFeatures` only for verified non-members and only when the
engine run catches the exact twin (package, file, complete source span, function and
mutation text). A missing, surviving, timed-out or unviable twin fails. The schema-1
control and aggregate documents add `not_compiled_without_features` to the existing
counters. The separate `inactive_without_features_caught_with_engine` class remains
counted globally, per `engine-default` partition and per package. Default-caught to
engine-unviable regressions and feature-only unviable mutants still fail.

`mutation-shards: 1` is the compatible default: it runs the existing inline
mutation command once, with no discovery listing; the worker and summary jobs
stay skipped. Opt-in
`mutation-shards: 0` lists all filtered mutants in the early `mutation-plan` job and chooses
`N = max(1, ceil(M / target))`, where `M` is the full count and `target` is
`mutation-mutants-per-shard` (default 50). Planning fails if `N` exceeds
GitHub's 256-job matrix limit. A fixed value `2` through `256` selects
`min(requested, M)` shards. No mode samples or discards mutants; when `N = 1`,
execution stays inline. With `M = 0`, no workers are scheduled and the inline
step records its established no-work message without inventing outcomes.

The target is a calibration knob, not a time estimate. Every shard retains its
own baseline and complete assigned mutant set with pinned cargo-mutants 27.1.0
using round-robin identity assignment. The early `mutation-plan` job validates the
consumer, installs the pinned compiler and mutation tool, and uploads the complete
immutable planning reports as `<artifact-name>-plan`. It does not compile the native
engine. The checks job and every Linux, engine, featureless-control and Windows
mutation worker start after planning succeeds, in parallel with one another. At
most 32 ordinary Linux workers run together. Checks download the same plan before
inline execution and include it in their diagnostic reports; workers verify the
same source, first parent, toolchain, configuration, diff and run-attempt bindings
as before. Planning failure skips checks and workers and fails the required status. Each ordinary worker has a 45-minute job limit, a
35-minute mutation-step limit and a 30-minute command timeout. On remote Linux shard jobs, GNU `timeout`
sends `SIGTERM` at that deadline and allows one minute before it sends
`SIGKILL`; local runs use the direct cargo-mutants invocation. The always-run
artifact upload retains the raw `caught.txt`, `missed.txt` and
`timeout.txt` lists; aggregation identifies incomplete shard indices, and
incomplete evidence fails `Required Rust CI`. The `N mutants untested in M shards`
diagnostic counts only Linux matrix shards; Windows-owned mutation failures remain
separate fail-closed errors. The `mutation-summary` job runs after the matrix even on
a failed or skipped worker, keeps raw shard directories separate,
and cross-checks each receipt, discovery list, completed outcome and counter
against the complete plan. A missing artifact, incomplete result, failed
baseline, survivor, timeout, foreign identity or invalid path blocks
`Required Rust CI`. A successful upload or matrix leg alone is never proof.
Sharded runs require a whole-workflow rerun so artifacts from separate attempts
cannot be mixed.

`mutation-test: false` disables planning and execution; both shard inputs are
still validated. Ruleset runs take `[ci]` settings from the first parent, so a
change to `maestro-quality.toml` cannot relax its own pull request; they take
`mutation-windows` from the head, which moves mutants to the Windows job and
never skips one. A called
workflow takes its declared inputs instead: a publisher or consumer caller
must forward shard settings and `mutation-windows` explicitly. Locally,
`rust-gate ci --local` marks remote planning and the Windows job not applied,
then runs the Linux mutation command once, unsharded, with the Windows-owned
files excluded. Keep project-specific exclusions in `.cargo/mutants.toml`; do not
turn off mutation testing just because a change outgrows one job.

In a sharded run, `checks` uploads `<artifact-name>-checks-reports` with the
plan; after aggregation, `mutation-summary` creates the canonical
`<artifact-name>-reports` bundle, including merged `mutants.json`, the summary
and the original per-shard outcomes, logs and diffs. Other callers keep the
existing report artifact name. The scorecard in `checks` marks mutation
`not-run` until aggregation finalizes it from verified evidence. The one
required job, `Required Rust CI`, requires every planned index and a successful
summary in addition to the plan, `checks` and requested portability results.

### Provisioned-host ownership

The optional tested-head `[ci.mutation-provisioned-host]` table transfers exact
Rust files to full-file provisioned-host mutation obligations. It never removes
changed coverable lines or edits LCOV hits. The policy, schema-1 plans,
`mutation-host-list.json`, `mutation-host-plan.log`, `mutation-host-plan.json`,
`host-outcomes.json`, `changed-coverage-pending.json` and
`changed-coverage-final.json` are described in
[the provisioned-host contract](provisioned-host.md).

No consumer enables this first gate slice. A configured host owner without the
executor result fails closed, including ordinary-inline and ordinary-empty
plans. The required host executor job follows separately. Ordinary and global
coverage thresholds, Windows ownership and engine controls remain unchanged.

### Platform portability

Every gate runs on `ubuntu-24.04`. `platforms` adds a `portability` job per
named platform, on a pinned runner: `macos` on `macos-15` (Apple silicon),
`windows` on `windows-2025` and `linux-arm` on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`. Each checks
out the same commit, installs the toolchain `mutation-plan` validated and runs
`cargo test --locked --workspace` in `working-directory`; it starts after
`mutation-plan`, which validated both, in parallel with `checks`. `Required Rust CI` fails when a named platform
did not pass. The job builds and tests only: release binaries, their bills of
materials and the scorecard stay Linux x86_64.

```yaml
    with:
      platforms: macos windows linux-arm
```

Every Rust repository of the organization tests Linux, macOS and Windows: a
ruleset run tests `macos` and `windows` when `[ci]` names no `platforms`. `maestro-quality.toml` may add a target, `[ci] platforms = "macos
windows linux-arm"`, but never drop either; a value that does is refused with
the fix:

```text
maestro-quality.toml: [ci] platforms `linux-arm` drops macos and windows, which every Rust repository tests: set it to `macos windows linux-arm`
```

A caller written by hand keeps the input's empty default.

### Public API compatibility

The `api` step compares a pull request's libraries with its base branch through
cargo-semver-checks, as a minor release: adding API passes, and removing an
item or changing it incompatibly fails. The comparison builds the base parent
the checkout already fetched, so it needs no registry and no published crate.
Only libraries whose manifest the base branch already has are compared; a
library the pull request adds is named in the report, and when every library is
new the step is not applicable.

A breaking change is declared the way release-please reads it, with `!` after
the type in the pull request title, `feat!:` or `fix(api)!:`; release-please
then cuts a major release, and the step records that it did not compare. It
also does not apply to a push or a tag, whose pull request was compared, to a
project without a library target, or on a toolchain older than Rust 1.93, the
oldest the pinned cargo-semver-checks runs on. Each of those writes its reason to
`api-compatibility.txt` and shows as not applicable in the scorecard, never as a
pass. Set `api-compatibility: false` to switch the gate off.

Outputs are strings, available through the final successful gate:

<!-- generated by just docs: outputs ci.yml -->

| Output | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `artifact-id` | Immutable GitHub release artifact ID in the current run; available only after the required gate |
| `artifact-name` | Exact artifact name for downstream verification |
| `revision` | The checked source SHA |

<!-- end generated -->

There are no required secrets. No general feature, arbitrary shell-command, target or
`ci-passed` inputs exist. CI sets `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` to the supported native
triple, overriding any consumer cross-target default. Prefer Cargo manifests/configuration and the exact
stable toolchain pin (`1.MINOR.PATCH`) in `rust-toolchain.toml`. Path traversal,
option-like paths, symlink escapes, unsafe artifact keys and nonnumeric/out-of-range
coverage are rejected before installation/build commands. Workspace manifests and
source target paths must also stay inside checkout.

Any exact stable version from the `1.85.0` MSRV up is accepted, read from
`rust-toolchain.toml` or from a nonempty `rust-version` override that selects the
compiler for the job without modifying the file; the file is still required and
must contain an exact stable pin. Channels, minor-only values and anything below
the MSRV fail before installation. Five pins (`1.85.0`, `1.95.0`, `1.96.1`,
`1.97.1`, `1.98.1`) are the tested set the consumer matrix proves; see the README.
Publishers omit this override and use the committed consumer pin.

## Mandatory checks

1. `cargo metadata --locked`, rustfmt, Clippy for all workspace targets with
   `-D warnings`, unit/integration tests and explicit doc tests, then rustdoc
   twice under `-D warnings -D missing_docs`: the public build, which alone
   refuses a public doc linking to a private item, and a build with
   `--document-private-items`, which refuses a broken intra-doc link or bad doc
   on a private item the first never reads.
2. `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --locked` emits nonempty LCOV and enforces the line
   threshold. Stable coverage does not include doc-test coverage; doc tests run
   separately. No implicit `--all-features` is used.
3. Pinned cargo-audit checks the lockfile against the live RustSec database.
   Pinned Gitleaks scans an archive of the entire current source revision (not
   Git history), uses built-in rules without consumer allowlists, and redacts
   100% of detected secret values. Unreviewed findings **and scanner execution
   errors fail**. Only [gate-owned reviewed exceptions](#reviewed-secret-scan-exceptions)
   can excuse a finding.
4. Release build and release-mode tests, verified packages of the members that
   may be published, per-member CycloneDX 1.5 JSON SBOMs, and release artifact
   staging. cargo-cyclonedx lacks `--locked`: a before/after lockfile comparison
   rejects resolution changes. Packaging first removes every `.crate` archive
   an earlier run left in `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/package`, restored from the cache
   or kept by a local run, so the payload holds only what this run packaged.
   `cargo package --locked` then takes one `--package` for each member whose
   `publish` is unset, `true` or names a registry, and leaves out every
   `publish = false` member, so a private workspace whose members depend on
   each other still builds. With no member to publish, nothing is packaged
   and the step prints a `SKIPPED` line; the release tests, the build and the
   SBOMs still run. A publishable member with a normal or build dependency on
   a `publish = false` member still fails: Cargo looks that dependency up in
   the registry it packages for, and the member could not be published
   either. A dev-dependency without a `version` is dropped from the package.
   With a compiler older than 1.90, packaging alone runs on Cargo 1.90.0:
   older Cargo looks a member's dependency on another member up on crates.io,
   so a workspace whose members depend on each other could not package.
5. Dependency sources and versions: `cargo deny check bans sources` against the
   consumer's `deny.toml`, or against the generated default policy without one.
6. `Required Rust CI` runs with `always()` and refuses failed, cancelled or
   unexpectedly skipped `checks`, each requested portability leg, the complete
   shard matrix and its summary. Missing plan outputs and a mismatched run
   attempt fail closed; report uploads cannot convert a failed check to success.
   Release artifact outputs are empty unless this required step succeeds.

Auxiliary tools are pinned independently of consumer Rust: cargo-llvm-cov 0.9.0,
cargo-audit 0.22.2, cargo-deny 0.20.2, cargo-cyclonedx 0.5.7, Gitleaks 8.24.3 and
jaq 3.1.1 among them, all installed by `rust-gate install-tools` from
checksum-verified prebuilt releases. The gate uses jaq for JSON; the one TOML
value it needs, the toolchain pin, is read as one quoted key and refused unless
it is exact.
`--locked` fixes dependency resolution; it does **not** mean offline.

## Artifact contract

Release artifact names combine the source SHA, native target, SHA256 of normalized
working-directory plus `artifact-key` plus selected Rust version, run ID and run
attempt. Different compiler versions do not collide; use different keys for
repeated invocations of the same directory and compiler in a run. The consumer matrix uses
separate keys for CI, binary dry-run and crate dry-run. Duplicate invocations fail
rather than overwrite immutable artifacts.

Each release artifact contains exactly `payload.tar.gz`, `provenance.json` and
`SHA256SUMS`. The payload includes compiled release binaries, verified `.crate`
packages of the members that may be published and each workspace member's
`<package>.cdx.json`. Provenance records
revision, target, binary names and SBOM names. Binary names must be safe and unique
across the workspace. Consumers must supply meaningful integration tests for
release binaries; the examples test their actual process output.

SBOM validation parses JSON and checks its CycloneDX version/envelope, component
metadata and containment in checkout; it is not a full external JSON-schema or
license-policy validation. Empty workspace SBOM output fails. This boundary is
intentionally smaller than a supply-chain policy engine.

Checksums detect corruption; same-run immutable artifact IDs and required CI
provide source association. They are not signed provenance attestations. The
binary publisher downloads by exact ID, checks required checksum selectors,
revision, native target and binary presence, and uploads the same validated files
without rebuilding. The protected job re-verifies them before the GitHub upload.

Release artifacts and diagnostic reports retain for **7 days**. Missing required
files fail. Reports upload on failure where available; earlier failures can mean
some reports do not exist. The consumer's cross-run caches are the Cargo registry
and target directory, keyed on the lockfile and compiler as described above.
The gate binary is rebuilt in a fresh directory and is never cached. GitHub's
cache scoping includes default-branch fallback; that scope does not authenticate
cached bytes or replace the separation of privileged jobs.
The hardening step sets cached objects aside and rebuilds every binary from clean
at its original target path, requiring the same digest, so a cached object
that no longer matches the source fails the run. Job-local Cargo state can be
rebuilt and never holds credentials.

## The gate action and the shared commands

The `gate` action under `.github/actions/` builds `rust-gate` and puts it on the
PATH of every later step; see [rust-gate.md](rust-gate.md). A workflow runs in
the consumer's checkout, so each job first checks this repository out at
`job.workflow_sha`, the commit of the workflow it runs, builds the gate from it,
and then checks out the consumer, which replaces that tree; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). What every step reads,
runs and writes is in [steps.md](steps.md), generated from the declarations
the gate enforces: an input, a tool or a report a step did not declare is
refused. Two commands serve more than one workflow.

### `rust-gate install-tools`

Downloads release assets from the fixed official GitHub origin, retrying a
failed download seven times, one second apart and doubling, two minutes in all,
verifies each digest before anything is extracted, and installs the
executables under the runner's temporary directory, on the PATH of every later
step. `ci.yml` installs `jaq`
before `validate`, which reads a ruleset run's settings through it, then its
mandatory toolbelt in one step and each optional gate's tool in its own step,
conditional on that gate (`a_job_installs_every_pinned_tool_before_a_step_invokes_it`);
the publishers and the attestation workflow install
`jaq` with it.

| Variable | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TOOLS` | required | One tool per line: `<name> <owner>/<repo>/releases/download/<tag>/<asset> <sha256> [<member>]`; the member is the executable's path inside an archive, omitted for a bare binary; `#` lines are comments |

### `rust-gate verify-payload`

Checks a downloaded release payload in the job about to publish or sign it:
no symlinks, a checksum manifest naming exactly `payload.tar.gz` and
`provenance.json`, checksums that hold, and a provenance whose revision is the
checked-out commit. Both publishers and `attest-binaries.yml` run it.

| Variable | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REVISION` | the workflow's `revision` input | The commit SHA the payload was built from; must equal the checked-out revision |
| `REQUIRE_BINARIES` | `true` or `false` | `true` refuses a payload whose provenance lists no binaries; the binary publisher sets it |

Output: `payload-digest`, the sha256 of `payload.tar.gz` computed from the
verified bytes; the attestation workflow signs exactly that digest.

## Repository testing

`ci-internal.yml` runs on every pull request and merge group, since this
repository's ruleset requires its two checks, `Required repository quality` and
`Required consumer tests`. It runs `CHECK_NETWORK=1 just check`: Rust development tests, the
gate crate's formatting, Clippy, unit tests and strict rustdoc, actionlint, zizmor,
yamlfmt, taplo, ShellCheck over the Just recipes and the gate action's build step, real
fixture checks and live advisory lookup. The isolated test crate uses
pinned jaq to parse YAML and serde_json for JSON. The documentation is checked
the same way: every input, output and secret has its row, every relative link
resolves, the Copilot inventory matches the tree, and every test a standard
cites is defined.
The same `ci-internal.yml` runs real local reusable-workflow calls for all three examples
on each of the five compiler pins (15 cases, capped at five concurrent jobs), plus
both dry-run publishers on each example's committed pin. `Required consumer tests`
rejects any failed/cancelled/skipped matrix. Configure required statuses only after inspecting their actual
names in GitHub; this directory has not been run there.

The failing-consumer regression executes the actual extracted `quality` and final
status steps, under the interpreter each one declares, with controlled failing
Cargo/status stand-ins. It proves
command and gate failure propagation, **not** GitHub's reusable-workflow scheduler.
Other boundary tests execute malformed paths, release configuration, scanner
errors, checksum corruption, revision mismatches and package selection. Real
Cargo and workflow lint checks complement those stand-ins.

### Optional native cache

A consumer can add this table to its committed `maestro-quality.toml`. It is
policy data, not another workflow input, and does not select engine features.

```toml
[native-cache]
environment = "FIXTURE_NATIVE_CACHE_DIR"
platforms = ["linux", "macos"]
key-files = ["Cargo.lock"]
published = ["entry-*"]
```

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `environment` | Consumer build variable. Process, Cargo, Rust, gate and runner control names are refused. |
| `platforms` | Selected Unix platforms: `linux` and/or `macos`. Windows is always disabled. |
| `key-files` | Existing project-relative regular files contained in the checkout. `Cargo.lock` is always included. |
| `published` | Completed immutable root-child entries to archive, never staging, Cargo targets or coverage profiles. |

The consumer must atomically publish completed entries and verify their native
source, compiler, target, profile, flags and feature compatibility before reuse.
An outer restore is not proof of compatibility or producer authenticity.
Cross-mode reuse requires matching consumer entry keys, including the flags that
change native output, as E03's native consumer binds them.

Feature coverage and every engine mutation shard restore. The coverage feature
child, API comparison (both head and baseline), cargo-hack feature checks and
engine cargo-mutants descendants receive the same reverified private root
variable. Default coverage and featureless, default and Windows mutation
execution remove an inherited configured variable but receive no cache root.
API and feature-check metadata also remove that variable when policy is present.
With policy present, API and feature-check Cargo children remove the configured
variable even on an unsupported platform; only a verified, platform-selected
root is ever injected.
Pre-validation mutation metadata retains its existing environment and runs no
build scripts. No variable is added to the job environment.

On a policy-selected Unix platform, both default and feature coverage executions
use `--no-rustc-wrapper`. Absent policy and unsupported platforms retain wrapper
mode. This instruments Rust dependencies too; its extra Rust compilation and
execution cost is unmeasured. The same-source coverage union and floor stay
unchanged. Native reuse still requires compatible consumer entry keys.

The checks job and engine shard zero are the only writers. They save last,
after job success, only when the published-entry inventory is nonempty and has
changed. Saving requires either a push to the repository's exact default branch
or a merge group whose base is that branch. Pull requests and manual dispatches
never save. A push caller must opt in on its default branch to warm other PRs;
merge-group archives stay in their queue ref scope and are not promoted to main.
PRs can restore default/base caches but cannot write them through this workflow.
Cache no secrets; other trusted producers sharing the namespace are a trust
boundary, and entry hashes are not signatures.

Keys bind OS, architecture, exact toolchain, repository/project identity, policy
and key-file bytes. Immutable snapshots append the coverage/mutation mode, run
ID and attempt. Restore tries the current mode's prefix, then the shared bucket
prefix. Feature spelling selects the routed mode but is not part of the outer
bucket key. Cross-OS archives are disabled.

The fixture coverage selection is workspace-qualified `crate-a/engine`; mutation
uses the package-local `engine` validated by its planner. Both share an outer
bucket. Their inner entries bind the instrumentation flags the native build
actually receives: coverage and mutation compile separate compatible entries.
Each mode pays one cold native build for a missing inner key and reuses its own
compatible entry on a warm run. An outer hit alone cannot require zero builds.

Restores live under a fresh owner-only parent outside the checkout. Safe owned
objects are normalized to owner-only permissions and rechecked. Symlinks,
hardlinks, special files, foreign ownership or failed checks discard the restore
and select an empty private source-build root. If safe allocation also fails,
the variable stays unset. Windows skips preparation, restore and save and builds
from source even with engine features selected.

To opt out, remove the entire `[native-cache]` table. Without a policy, mutation,
coverage, API and feature-check child commands and inherited environments remain
unchanged.

### Native cache transport reports

An opted-in feature-coverage or engine mutation run writes `native-cache-binding.txt` with the
policy, key-file digests and snapshot key. `native-cache-before.txt` records the
verified private root and its published-entry inventory once before the first
selected execution. Later commands reverify the root without replacing that
initial record, so a no-new-entry command cannot suppress a valid save.
Restore failure selects an empty private root and does not save that fallback.
Every selected root, including a random fallback, must be an owned directory
with exactly mode 0700. If allocation or verification fails, the variable stays unset.

An absent `[native-cache]` key disables the policy; a present non-table value
is refused. Ruleset settings snapshots validate only policy shape. Transport
preparation resolves key files and their digests against the tested project.
With a policy present, coverage removes the configured variable from each Cargo
child's inherited environment, then sets it only on the verified feature child.
Mutation removes it at the shared cargo-mutants execution seam and sets it only
for a verified engine worker after plan validation.
Without a policy, child environments and the job environment stay unchanged.

The hosted fixture uses the committed consumer at
`tests/fixtures/native-consumer-project/`, byte-checked against its generator.
Coverage binds to the job's own commit, with no override of GitHub's default
variables. A separate assertion prints the empty checkout status immediately
before coverage; build output, reports and cache entries stay outside the checkout.
All workflow, job and step `env` keys refuse the reserved `GITHUB_*` and `RUNNER_*` prefixes.

The hosted fixture runs coverage on pull requests, push, merge group and manual
dispatch. Its separate Linux mutation planner and two engine shards run on push,
merge group and dispatch only. The shallow checkout follows the existing full
listing path; PR mutation jobs skip because their base requires a first parent.
A non-default dispatch demonstrates mutation restore without save. Fixture cache
steps and the engine command are equality-checked against `ci.yml`; mutation
artifacts retain child traces, before-inventory, native build counts and outcomes.
These optional proof jobs do not extend the required repository quality job.

The hosted fixture records `cache-hit` separately from `cache-matched-key`.
A nonempty matched key identifies a restore, including a prefix restore;
verified compatible entries can therefore require zero native source builds.

Published selectors are exact root-child names or `*`/`?` globs; hidden names
are allowed, but `.`, `..`, separators, `**`, brackets, braces and escapes are refused.

## Provisioned-host execution reports

The required Ubuntu `mutation-host` job retains `host-artifacts`, including
`host-outcomes.json`, every schema-1 request and result, baseline and phase logs,
current Cargo JSON logs, `host-progress.json` and interruption diagnostics.
The independent always-run cleanup result remains alongside these artifacts.
Aggregation downloads the same-attempt host artifact and joins it to the early
plan and pending changed coverage. A survivor, incomplete proof or failed cleanup
keeps the job and Required Rust CI red. See [the protocol](provisioned-host.md).
